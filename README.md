# throneRoom

This is our adaptation of the barber shop problem.

There is a throne room with a King and his subjects. 

The king is sitting on the throne and the subjects come to ask favors or questions of the king.
The king processes the request one by one.
The subjects wait on an empty chair in the throne room.
When the room is empty majesty sleeps on her throne.
When the king is asleep and someone enter the room, the jester wakes up the king, 
When the room is full, the subjects go back in the city.
